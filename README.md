Details

tag: it is shell script that uses `readtags` to parse tags generated by Universal Ctags and produces output useful for Acme.  For example, it may generate
`/a/b/c/somefile.h:/^    struct foo$/`
Since there are whitespaces in the regex, you have to select the whole line and then use mouse-3 to jump to the desired location.
